## Overview

![](resources/screenshot.png)

NFT Preview Card Component is a challenge from Frontend Mentor, where the proposal 
is to create a centered card that shows an NFT, the description of its collection,
price, available time, and attribution to the artist.

## My process

This project was made with the [replit.com](https://replit.com) IDE, where I used basic HTML and CSS. 
Also, I used some basic Flexbox properties to properly center the NFT card and the logos.

Working on this project I was able to better develop my CSS skills, where I learned
key concepts of Flexbox, responsiveness and how to import external fonts into the code.

Although I think the code could be better optimized, I managed to get the expected result. 
With this project done, I want to continue developing my front-end skills, learn more
about Flexbox, and do bigger and more complex projects.
